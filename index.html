                <p>
                    Many of us dropped the board after finishing school or college but still feel the itch to skate.
                    Plenty have either lost touch with the people they used to skate with or are the only one that wants
                    to skate again.
                    If you are of like mind then sign up now and connect with others.

                    Looking to start? Our meetups are chill and without judgement.
                    If you have a desire to learn we have motivated skaters that love to see people learn a new trick
                    just as much as learning it themselves.
                    The best time to start skating was in your teenage years. The second best time is right now! Stop
                    putting off what you want to do and sign up now!

                    Skating is a great way to make new friends. Hanging out for hours trying new tricks or just sitting
                    around the skate-park
                    after a session talking about anything. In todays online world it can be a daunting experience
                    trying to make new friends
                    thats why we are running it back to simplier times. Common interests are common grounds and make for
                    brilliant ice breakers so sign up now and lets skate!.

                    An often overlooked part of skateboarding is the benefits on health. Skateboarding is not only a
                    great cardio workout its also an extremely affordable
                    hobby. It improves coordination and strenght and can even be a great mode of transport if you are
                    city living. It also drills in how to fall safely
