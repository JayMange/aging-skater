                        Many of us dropped the board after finishing school or college but still feel the itch to skate. 
                        Plenty have either lost touch with the people they used to skate with or are the only one that wants to skate again. 
                        If you are of like mind then sign up now and connect with others.

                    <p>
                        Looking to start? Our meetups are chill and without judgement. 
                        If you have a desire to learn we have motivated skaters that love to see people learn a new trick just as much as learning it themselves. 
                        The best time to start skating was in your teenage years. The second best time is right now! Stop putting off what you want to do and sign up now!
